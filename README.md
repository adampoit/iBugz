# Building the app

In order to build the app, you should probably have Python 2.7 installed, since that's what I've tested it on. Simply run:

`python setup.py py2app`

This will compile the app and put it into the `dist/` directory.

# I don't feel like building the app

A current (hopefully) version of the app is checked into the `dist/` directory for your convenience.
