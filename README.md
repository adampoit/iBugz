## Building the app

In order to build the app, you will need to have a few dependencies installed.

* Python 2.7
* [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)

Then simply run:

`python setup.py py2app`

This will compile the app and put it into the `dist/` directory.

## I don't feel like building the app

A current (hopefully) version of the app is checked into the `dist/` directory for your convenience.
